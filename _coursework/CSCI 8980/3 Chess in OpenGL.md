# Chess in OpenGL

In fall 2019 I took **Game Engine Technologies** with Dr. Stephen Guy. My classmate [Tien Dinh](mailto:dinh0080@umn.edu) and I collaborated on this project.

Our directive was to create a game in the [provided game engine](/coursework/csci-8980/acceleration-techniques-in-opengl), using only Lua scripting. Additionally, our game had to demonstrate some form of animation. We chose to create chess.

## Source Code

The source code is available to download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15e5d5eMOY7Mnlr6pb9vtDpczVOlYjQ4Q?usp=sharing).

We also ported an [open source easing library](https://github.com/nicolausYes/easing-functions/blob/master/src/easing.cpp) to Lua for use in our project.
