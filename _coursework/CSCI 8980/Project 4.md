# Project 4

## Spherical Snake

For project 4 I took a game I had been working on previously, and upgraded the visuals by writing custom shaders for a stylized look. The game is a version of the classic computer game "Snake", but played on a spherical world rather than a flat grid.

## Source Code

I used  [Unity](https://unity.com/) to make the game, and [Amplify Shader Editor](http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor/) to create the shaders.

I made all of the 3D models myself except for the bottle and barrel which are by [Ajay Karat](http://www.procjam.com/art/devil.html), and the rocks which are by [John Gillessen](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/peacefull-place-f755bba1783e4109b8037f4b56b56fb6).

The source code is available to download [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15e5d5eMOY7Mnlr6pb9vtDpczVOlYjQ4Q?usp=sharing).
