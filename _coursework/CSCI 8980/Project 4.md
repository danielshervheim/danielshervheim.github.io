# Project 4

## Spherical Snake

The goal for project 4 was to explore shaders and how they affect the appearence of the objects rendered in a game engine. I decided to take a game I had already been working on and improve the appearence by writing my own shaders.

The game I made was a version of the classic computer game Snake, but played on a spherical map rather than a 2D map. This is what it looked like previously:

> The game as it appeared previously, with no visual upgrades.

I created concept art for how I wanted the game to look ideally. My goal was to try and recreate the concept as closely as possible, using custom shaders wherever possible.

After working for a few weeks I am reasonably pleased with the results I achieved. I think I was able to capture the spirit of the concept art fairly well.

There were a few key visual elements I knew I had to achieve. I detail them below.
