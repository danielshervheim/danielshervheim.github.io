# Project 4
## Spherical Snake

The goal for project 4 was to explore shaders and how they affect the appearence of the objects rendered in a game engine. I decided to take a game I had already been working on and improve the appearence by writing my own shaders.

The game I made was a version of the classic computer game Snake, but played on a spherical map rather than a 2D enclosure. This is what it looked like previously:
