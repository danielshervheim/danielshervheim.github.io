# Other Worlds

![splash](/assets/img/sayge/splash.png)

Other Worlds is the MFA thesis show of artist [Sayge Carroll](https://www.saygemorgan.com/work?pgid=irngfjsm-427ee7fd-4c34-423a-9dff-6bda84a725c2).

I was responsible for creating the virtual 3D environment based on a full 3D scan of herself, and photographs of her ancestors. On a technical level I
- Sculpted the terrain by hand in Blender
- Processed the terrain to generate LOD meshes and various maps for shading in Houdini
- Filled the terrain with procedurally placed vegetation and other natural assets
- Programmed the interaction
