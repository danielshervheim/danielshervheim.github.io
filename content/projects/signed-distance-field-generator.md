# Signed Distance Field Generator

![sdf](/assets/img/sdf/sdf.gif)

A Unity tool to generate signed distance field volumes (as Texture3D assets) from meshes.

I wrote this with the intention of using it for collision detection with my GPU-based particle system, but I never got around to merging the two.

Find installation and usage instructions on my Github page [here](https://github.com/danielshervheim/Signed-Distance-Field-Generator).
