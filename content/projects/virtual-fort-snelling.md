# Virtual Fort Snelling

![commanders-house](/assets/img/virtual-fort-snelling/commanders-house-2021.png)

Virtual Fort Snelling is a digital recreation of Fort Snelling and the surrounding area over the past 200 years. From the project page:

> "The goal of this project is to allow users to see the site of Fort Snelling at Bdote as it looked in many different periods. Although this historic site has been Dakota homeland for thousands of years, and was an active-use settler colonial military site for 125 years, visitors today mainly see the reconstructed 1820s frontier fort. This 3D landscape model is being created using digital elevation models, historic maps and photographs, archaeological remains, oral histories, and archived documents."

I was the primary developer on this project, and wrote my [master's thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZC06919tBEi-5DSpXNErh5OzCszGL2NQ/view?usp=sharing) on my technical contributions. I was responsible for:

- Terrain creation using a combination of LIDAR-derived height data and hand-sculpted details
- Terrain processing and LOD generation in Houdini
- Building modelling in Blender
- Scene setup using historical reference material
- Terrain blending, river, foliage, and other shader-based material effects
- Interaction programming
- UI design and implementation
