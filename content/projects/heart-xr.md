# HeartXR

![splash](/assets/img/heart-xr/splash.png)


HeartXR is an interactive digital model of a real human heart. It allows users to dynamically cut the heart model with a plane, and in doing so visualize the complex internal structures.

I was responsible for the following tasks:
- Writing the shaders to allow for dynamically cutting the heart geometry
- Creating the desktop viewer application
- Creating the VR viewer application

## Try it Yourself

Builds are currently available for the following platforms:

- [macOS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LQ6sdC2Mh1M7L5TfGYzLJBoZ7Da5lrRY/view?usp=sharing)
- [Windows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18981-8iFeELKev6kX3uQGFUSuUmllrl7/view?usp=sharing)
- [Windows (VR via OpenXR)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ML656S-UOkmIRFjkYf4qzpeYCJ8E1xhr/view?usp=sharing)
