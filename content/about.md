## Hey there,

I'm Daniel!

I'm currently a designer at Apple.

Previously I studied computer science at the University of Minnesota and worked both as a CSCI teaching assistant, and in the [AISOS](http://aisos.umn.edu/) lab where I helped build informative digital experiences.

In my spare time I like to read, listen to podcasts, explore the great outdoors, and spend time with my friends and family.

My resume is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qzsC1fZBmPHVkkWohMgnye5y0L1zPw6r998nnW5ZO0/edit?usp=sharing).
