## Hey there,

I'm Dan!

I'm interested in technology and art, which has led me to study computer graphics.

I graduated in January 2022 with an M.S. in computer science from the University of Minnesota. During my time there, I worked as a computer science teaching assistant and at [AISOS](http://aisos.umn.edu/), where I helped build informative digital experiences.

I currently work at Apple as a graphics engineer.

In my spare time I like to read, draw, play games, listen to podcasts, and spend time with my friends and family.

My resume is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qzsC1fZBmPHVkkWohMgnye5y0L1zPw6r998nnW5ZO0/edit?usp=sharing).
