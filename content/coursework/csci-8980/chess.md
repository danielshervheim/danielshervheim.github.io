# Chess

A project for Dr. Stephen Guy's class **Game Engine Technologies**. My classmate [Tien Dinh](mailto:dinh0080@umn.edu) and I collaborated on this project..

Our directive was to create a game in the [provided game engine](/coursework/csci-8980/frustum-culling-in-opengl), using only Lua scripting. Additionally, our game had to demonstrate some form of animation. We chose to create a chess game.

## Source Code

We also ported an [open source easing library](https://github.com/nicolausYes/easing-functions/blob/master/src/easing.cpp) to Lua for use in our project.
