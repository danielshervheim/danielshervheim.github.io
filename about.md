## Hey there,

I'm Dan!

Iâ€™m studying computer science with a focus on computer graphics at the [University of Minnesota](https://www.cs.umn.edu/). I currently work as a computer science teaching assistant and at [AISOS](http://aisos.umn.edu/), where I help build informative digital experiences.

I plan to graduate in December 2019, and intend to pursue a master's degree in computer science at the university.

In my spare time I like to read, draw, make games, spend time with my family, and explore the world around me!

My resume is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAoeWMVmRG-uOplchmDD8qh1SfPuwfCJ26882EFppic/edit?usp=sharing).
