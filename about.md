## Hey there,

I'm Dan!

Iâ€™m studying computer science with a focus on graphics programming at the [University of Minnesota](https://www.cs.umn.edu/). I work as a teaching assistant and at [AISOS](http://aisos.umn.edu/), both at the U.

I plan to graduate in December 2019, and intend to continue at the U to pursue my Masters degree in computer science.

In my spare time I like to read, draw, make 3D models, program games, spend time with my family and explore!

My resume is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAoeWMVmRG-uOplchmDD8qh1SfPuwfCJ26882EFppic/edit?usp=sharing).
