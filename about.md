## Hey there

I'm Dan!

I currently study and work at the University of Minnesota. Iâ€™m a senior studying computer science with a focus on graphics programming. I work as an undergraduate teaching assistant, as well as at the [AISOS lab](http://aisos.umn.edu/) at the U.

I plan to graduate in December 2019, and intend to continue into graduate school at the U.

In my spare time I like to read, draw, make 3D models, program games, and spend time with my family.

My resume is available to download [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pAoeWMVmRG-uOplchmDD8qh1SfPuwfCJ26882EFppic/edit?usp=sharing).
