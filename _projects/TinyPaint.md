# TinyPaint

![img](/assets/img/tinypaint/splash.png)

## About

TinyPaint is a lightweight painting and image editing application for Unix systems, written in C. (The compiled executable is less than 300 kilobytes)!

I wrote it as an exercise in UI programming, and to better familiarize myself with the Gtk, Gdk, and Glib libraries.

Currently it supports 6 different brushes, 10 different filters, undo/redo, and image saving/loading.

## How to Use
