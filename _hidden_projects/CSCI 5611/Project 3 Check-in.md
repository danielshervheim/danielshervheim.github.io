I am working with a partner for this assignment. This was a joint effort between myself and [Ben Lemma](mailto:lemma017@umn.edu).

In the video, we generate 75 random points. We then move the points outside of obstacles, if necessary. We construct a list of neighbors (based on visibility between points), and search the resulting graph to find the optimal path.

All possible paths are shown in the editor view (left) in white, and the optimal path in blue. The final render is shown to the right.
