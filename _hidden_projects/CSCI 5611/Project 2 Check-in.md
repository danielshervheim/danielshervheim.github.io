Code can be found on my UMN Github page [here](https://github.umn.edu/sherv029/S19_5611/tree/master/Homework 2/Checkin/Assets/Scripts).

In the demo I spawn 50 threads and let them fall. Realistic “wavy” behavior is visible as the threads sway back and forth and bounce under the effect of the mass-spring-damper system.

I additionally added a toggle to enable or disable the “rest length” equilibrium. By default springs will attempt to maintain a “rest length”. When toggling this off, springs will attempt to compress as much as possible. This is visible as the springs bunch up (turning it off) and then spread out (turning it on).
