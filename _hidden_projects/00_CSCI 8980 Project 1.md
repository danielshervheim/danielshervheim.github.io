### CSCI 8980 Project 1

Upon completion of your game, prepare a written report (ideally about 3-4 pages), discussing all the following aspects about your game and its implementation:

#### Gameplay / Game Design:
- Give a brief summary of the game(along with a screenshot). What’s the goal? Are there any points? How are they scored? Any powerups or other special abilities?
- From a design perspective, what are some features you didn’t get to? How would you improve your gameplay if given more time?

#### Algorithmic Discussion:
- What are the key algorithms and techniques you used in developing your game? How do these algorithms improve your computational runtime or user experience?
- From a computational perspective, what are the bottlenecks/limiting factors in your game?  If given more time, what algorithmic improvements would you make?

#### Game Engine Analysis:
- Processing provides fairly low-level support for game development. What aspects would have made your game easier if they were already provided? Which of these would be useful for other games?
- In the process of creating your game, you’ve already made some key aspects of a game engine. Describe the key components of how your game works, and how they relate to each other. For example: what systems are responsible for triggering sounds being played? where is the state of the game stored?

For each of these three high-level areas, please include at least one image, figure, or chart that complements your discussion.

#### Submission:
To turn in your assignment, create a webpage with the following:
1. A video of your game being played
2. Your complete source code, and a list of any libraries used
3. The above described report

You should also prepare to give a short, in class presentation on your design choices and to provide feedback to (and receive feedback from) others in the class.
