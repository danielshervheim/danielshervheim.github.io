<p>A virtual reality (Google Cardboard) tour of the <em>Military Intelligence Service Language School</em> (MISLS) at Fort Snelling, in Minnesota.</p>

<p>This project was a joint effort between the <a href="http://aisos.umn.edu/">AISOS</a> lab at <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">UMN</a>, and Professor <a href="https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/kathayes">Katherine Hayes</a>, also at UMN.</p>

<p>Fort Snelling housed a language school to teach Japanese during the second world war. The building has since fallen into disrepair and is closed to the public. In 2015, members of the AISOS lab were granted access to photograph the inside of the building. 3D models were reconstructed from the many thousands of photographs taken on location. The resulting models were used to create a virtual reality experience to guide people through the buildings history.</p>

<p>I was responsible for the following contributions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Retopologizing the 3D models in Agisoft Metashape.</li>
  <li>Cleaning up the models and UV maps in blender.</li>
  <li>Programming in Unity (mainly the map and audio systems).</li>
  <li>Optimization for mobile VR in Unity.</li>
</ul>
